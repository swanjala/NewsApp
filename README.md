# NewsApp
### Android Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project.
A simple news application that consumes the newsapi.org API to get news data.

#### Note: To run the app you have to add [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/register) key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)

#### Application setup.
1. Register on [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/register) to get your API Key
2. Paste the API key in your `local.properties` *(Create the file if not exists)*
   NAP_KEY=COPIED_API_KEY
